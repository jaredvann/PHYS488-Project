### Super LHC track-trigger project
Feasibility/design study for a track trigger to be implemented Study in the ATLAS experiment at the LHC.

The LHC and its proposed successor the super-LHC produce billions of collisions per second. Experiments, such as the ATLAS experiment, can record at best a few hundred such collisions per second. It is therefore required to accept or reject collisions on-the-fly based on a very fast determination of the properties of these collisions.

An important selection criterion can be the presence of a trajectory in the tracking detectors of the experiment, originating from a high momentum lepton. You will study whether a very simple 2 layer coincidence detector could be used for this purpose. As part of the project you will generate muons, which you will track through a series of thin detectors located in a magnetic field, and generate hits in two of these detectors. Using these hits you then assess how well these data allow you to separate between very abundant low momentum particle and rare high momentum particles. At a later stage you can study how well you would expect this performance to hold up in the presence of thousands of other particles from the same collision.
